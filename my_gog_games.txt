* Age of Wonders 3: Shadow Magic
  * PlayOnLinux
    Script exists for "Age of Wonders" (no specific version), but fails for GoG install
    (shortcut to wrong directory)
    Running AoWSM.exe: 
      -> need virtual desktop (biscreen); Or "window" in setup, even better
      -> sluggish responses
      -> according to WineHQ: Cursor: color; Direct3D: no
         improves cursor tramatically, game still lags
      -> "Verrouillage du mode cible de rendu = readtex" helps somewhat

  * Crossover Games 10
    Installs ok, but shortcut created (with GoG tweaks) doesn't work; 
    Also creates link to: Config (AoWSMSetup.exe), Editor (AoWSMEd.exe),
      Quickplay Guide (QuickStart.pdf), Readme (Readme.html)
    Running AoWSM.exe starts the ok (video), then lots of stability problems
    -> Cursor: colors helps a lot

  No matter the Wine version I tried, without native DirectSound (dsound) I
  get sounds looping forever, which gets on nerves quite efficiently.
  According to Crossover (http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=3753;tips=1)
  this can be fixed by selecting "Built-in Output" in SettingsApplication.exe
  sound tab. Then you get desync/delayed/cropped sounds... Giving up for now
