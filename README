This is my repository of PlayOnLinux scripts for games available from
Good Old Games (http://www.gog.com/): classical/retro gaming for a small
price tag, and no DRM!


"wip" subdirectory contains scripts that are not fully satisfying
(some features that do not work, or even rare crashes). Gaming
experience may still be fun, but with some reserves.

"broken" subdirectory contains failed scripts attempts, or so poor
results that the game cannot really be enjoyed. Only useful for
further research, possibly with new releases of Wine.
